# Developer Metrics
## What works, what doesn't work?

# Agenda

1. The promise
2. The problems
3. Some success
4. Questions
---
class: backgroundy-firefox

# Introduction
* Currently at GitHub:
  * Currently at 4 reports
  * Hiring another 7 reports
* Formerly at Mozilla:
  * Pretty typical IC üëâüèº EM transition
  * Between 2 and 14 reports
* Always **remote**
---
# Our role
* As an EM we have **many** responsibilities:
  * Keep it healthy
  * Spot problems
  * Ship code
  * Report progress
  * Grow team
---
# Data points
* Qualitative:
  * Reviews, 1:1, observation
  * Hard to scale
* Quantitative:
  * Stories completed
  * Tickets completed, bugs introduced
  * Reviews done
  * Easier to scale
---
# The problems
* Any metric **without context** is meaningless
* Comparison **without context** is dangerous
* Not telling developers **breaks trust**
---
# Bad metrics
* Lines of code is **not** good
  * [Folklore about Quickdraw (from 1982)](https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.txt)
* Number of bugs is probably **not** good
  * Are all your bugs the same size?
  * Was that a quick fix at the cost of quality?
  * Did it introduce more bugs?
---
# Some success
* Got some basic charts from Bugzilla and GitHub
* Shared those numbers and the source regularly
* Helped...
  * Spotting when people were stuck
  * When deviations from norm occurred
  * When managing people out

# We can do better...
Some examples
---
# Example: Security bugs
* Can be stressful
* Very time consuming
* So locked down, they weren't being counted
* Then we found ***one person*** was doing them
---
# Example: Priority one bugs
* Can be stressful
* Often on the critical path
* Turned around fast
* We found people who did ***lots of P1s***
* Question: High performer or on the road to burnout?
* Inverse: lots of lowest priority bugs?
---
# Example: Outstanding reviews
* A review is another developer asking for something
* I get stressed when that ***happens to me***
* People with a large review queue were more stressed
* And it was a bottle neck across the org.
---
# The result
* Work was redistributed
* These become graphs we would monitor
* ...some people had easier lives
---
# For me...
How can I predict shipping times, spot high performers, make things better for myself.

Became... üëáüèº

How can I help my team be happier, reduce stress and become better.
